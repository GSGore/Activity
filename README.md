## Overview

The Diet and Activity Recommender is a machine learning model that takes into account various user inputs such as age, weight, height, gender, and activity level to suggest personalized diet plans and physical activities. It uses a dataset of nutritional information and physical activity guidelines to make recommendations tailored to individual needs.

## Features

- **Personalized Diet Recommendations:** Based on user's nutritional needs (calories, macros).
- **Activity Recommendations:** Recommends physical activities based on user's fitness level.
- **User Profile Management:** Allows users to create and update their profiles.
- **Scalable Model:** Can be expanded to incorporate additional features and datasets.

## Dataset

The model uses a dataset containing:
- Nutritional information (calories, macros) for various foods.
- Physical activity guidelines and calorie burn rates for different exercises.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)
